# FOAAS - Fuck Off As A Service

[FOAAS](https://www.foaas.com/) (Fuck Off As A Service) provides a modern, RESTful, scalable solution to the common problem of telling people to fuck off.

This API was just screaming for an R wrapper! So here it is.

### Installation

Use devtools to install the package:
`devtools::install_github("56north/foaas")`

### Usage
You use it by calling one of the 72 different functions.

```{r}
library(foaas)

foaas_everyone("me")
```

The functions return a message and a subtitle. 

There you go!. Now f*ck off! :)
